# plex-delete-watched
Very basic code to generate a list of watched TV shows that can be deleted on a Plex Home server

My hard drive got full and I couldn't find a simple way to delete shows that have been watched without manually working through folders and comparing with watched/unwatched state in plex.
This has become tedious since the addition of plex home where more and one person may or may not have watched the same show.

There are other projects that are more comprehensive than this but they required a knowledge of python and dont seem to handle a Plex Home setup, where several people can watch the same shows at different times.

<h1>Progress</h1>
At this stage I'm just trying to generate a basic list of watched shows that are 'safe to delete'.
I'll look to add back-end code to handle the deletion on the server later.

This is my first public project on GitHub so please bear that in mind when laughing at my code ;)
